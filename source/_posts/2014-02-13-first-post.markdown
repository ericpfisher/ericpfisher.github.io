###Thank You, Octopress

Round of applause for Octopress for making this "I-have-skill-and-want-to-maintain-my-own-blog-but-I-didn't-go-to-school-for-web-development" thing so easy. You see that _Powered by Octopress_ at the bottom of this page? Click it.

I'm also really liking [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) quite a bit. I ran through a quick Markdown [tutorial](www.markdowntutorial.com) and within 30 minutes, I feel I have enough MD skill to write this post...so **that's** something.

On the subject of Markdown, I had no idea it was created by John Gruber of [_The Daring Fireball_](http://daringfireball.net) fame. I was even more surprised to learn that the creation of Markdown was greatly assisted by the late [Aaron Swartz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz). Now that I know a tiny bit about the language and I've witnessed first-hand how easy it is to use, it makes perfect sense something this simple and powerful would come from a pair like those two. Although, the English major in me is having a hard time not double-spacing after every sentence...damn you, soft break!

###WhyTF Am I Writing This???

Yeah, I've tried to start blogs before. I had a Xanga back in the day. I think it's still out there, actually.  I've tried keeping a word processor document on my computer with various dates and thoughts. Always failed within a week. I'm just not driven to write; I have to work for it.

So, _this_ thing will (hopefully) be different. I was inspired by [_Confessions of an Unlikely Developer_](http://joshuakemp.blogspot.com). Dude was a farrier (you can Google it, you have my blessing) and one day said, "F*** it. I'm going to be a developer."

No degree.  
No overt technology background.  
Three hours of study a day.  
Attending regular coding meetups.  
Practice + practice + more practice.

Eight months later and he's a Junior Developer (props to him for sure!). 

Here I am with an overt technology background (I worked as a technician at Apple, dammit!), I've built websites and scripts before, and I can't scrape together the time to hone in and make my work goal (to code for a living) a reality?! F*** that. (I still can't decide how candid I want to be on this thing, so bear with my censoring for now.)

I'm going to use this blog to track my progress, catalog things I learn, and push myself to keep going. I love to learn, but I hate learning when I feel like it's going nowhere. This blog is to prove myself wrong. I'm gonna learn me some Ruby.
